# Christians-Steam-Bot

This is a simple project using my Steam-Framework.

Basically, a console-only bot that makes most of the current Framework available:
* handling sale events (discovery queue and stickers)
* "playing" games -- no automated farming yet
* sending inventories to another bot account
* accepting/cancelling trades
* some account information
* automated logins to maintain booster pack eligibility
